<!-- You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods). -->

<!-- Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. -->

The objective of this textbook is to provide you with the shortest path to exploring your data, visualizing it, forming hypotheses and validating and defending them. Given a data set, you want to be able to make any plot you wish, find plots which show something actionable and interesting, explore data by slicing and dicing it and finally present your results in a statistically convincing manner, perhaps in a colorful and visually appealing way.

Questions which you will have to anticipate and you will have to answer are
- How do you know that your findings are not random?
- And fundamental of all questions:
- **So what?**

Even the most impressing looking results may come up randomly. And you will be asked this question along with the question *“what was your p-value and how did you compute it”*

And even if you convince your audience that your results are not random, you will have to be ready to explain why your audience should care about the results you reported. In other words, is there any actionable value in your results? Or they are just simply interesting, good to know, but no one really needs to care much about them otherwise? Hopefully it is the former not the latter.


In the following sections we will address these questions and go through the process of data exploration, validation, and presentation.

- We will start with making plots, follow with free style data exploration – which allows us to form the leads, that is hypotheses. Then we will follow with simple statistical tests which will allow us to validate these hypothesis and defend our findings against randomness claims. - We will learn how to calculate p-values and how to use them to defend our findings. 
- We will use as few R commands as possible and reach our goal in the shortest possible path. In fact we will demonstrate how using just 7 R commands we can perform quite sophisticated data exploration.  In the appendix, we show many more useful commands of R which eventually you would have to use. However, our goal in this short textbook, is to present the  shortest path to data analysis which will let you import the data, plot it, make some analysis yourself and use R-libraries.  In this textbook and in this class we do not teach how to clean the data (data wrangling) and how to deal with a wide variety of data types. We also do not address complex data transformations such as multi-frame operations like merge (we show them in appendix).  We also do not explain how different machine learning methods work, we only show you how to use them. It is similar to teaching one how to drive a car without knowing how a car engine works.

## How to upload a data set?
<script src="files/js/dcl.js"></script>
```{r ,include=FALSE}
tutorial::go_interactive()

```

 - To upload the dataset/file present in csv format the read.csv() and read.csv2() functions are frequently used The read.csv() and read.csv2() have different separator symbol: for the former this is a comma, whereas the latter uses a semicolon.

- There are two options while accessing the dataset from your local machine:
  1. To avoid giving long directory paths for accessing the dataset, one should use the command **getwd()** to get the current working directory and store the dataset in the same directory. 
  
![Getwd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/5_text.png)

- To access the dataset stored in the same directory one can use the following: **read.csv("MOODY_DATA.csv")**.

![Store the moody dataset in the same directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/6_text.png)

  2. One can also store the dataset at a different location and can access it using the following command: (Suppose the dataset is stored inside the folder Data101_Tutorials on the desktop)
  
    - For Windows Users.
      - Example: read.csv("C:/Users/Desktop/Data101_Tutorials/MOODY_DATA.csv")

    - For MAC Users.
      - Example: read.csv("/Users/Desktop/Data101_Tutorials/MOODY_DATA.csv")
      

**Note: **
The directory path given here is the current working directory hosted on *Github* where the dataset has been stored.
```{r, tut=TRUE}

# Read in the data
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

# Print out `df`
head(df)
```

---

## Saving your work

- To save your work go to **File -> Save**. It will ask you to give a name for your **.R file** and then click on Save.

![Save](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/7_text.png)

- After making modifications to your saved file, you will need to save the file again. 
If the name of the file on the top is in <span style="color: red;"> Red Color </span> indicates that the file have **unsaved** changes.

![Unsaved File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/8_text.png)


- Go to **File -> Save** to save your .R file again. After saving the file the color of the file name i.e. **HW1.R** will again change back to **black**.

![Saved File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/9_text.png)

**Note: ** You can create multiple files inside the same project such as for your each homework assignments

## Vector

<script src="files/js/dcl.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

```{r ,include=FALSE}
tutorial::go_interactive( greedy = FALSE)

```
- A vector is simply a list of items that are of the same type.

<!-- To combine the list of items to a vector, use the **c()** function and separate the items by a comma.
- All of the items inside a vector to are of the same type like numerical or categorical. -->

### Snippet 1

Lets look at example of creating a vector:

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=300}

#Lets create 3 vectors with title, author and year.
color <- c('Red','Blue','Yellow','Green')

#Lets look at how the created vectors look.
color
```

### Snippet 2

Create a vector with numerical values in a sequence, use the **:** operator:

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=300}

#Lets create a vectors with numerical sequence.
year <- 2018:2022

#Lets look at how the created vectors look.
year

```
<!--
<br />

- To find out how many items a vector has, use the **length()** function:

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=300}

#Lets create a vectors with categorical values
author <- c('Foreman', 'John', 'Said')

# You can access the vector items by referring to its index number inside brackets []. The first item has index 1, the second item has index 2, and so on:
author[1]

#Lets look at the size of a vectors.
length(author)

```

<br />

- To sort items in a vector alphabetically or numerically, use the **sort()** function and to change the value of a specific item, refer to the **index number**:

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=300}

#Lets create a vectors with categorical values
title <- c('Data Smart','Orientalism','False Impressions','Making Software')

#sorting titles
sort(title)

# change the title 'Data Smart' to 'Smart Data'
title[1] <- "Smart Data"

#Lets look at how the updated vectors look.
title 
```

## Data Frames

<script src="files/js/dcl.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

```{r ,include=FALSE}
tutorial::go_interactive( greedy = FALSE)

```
- Data Frames are data displayed in a format as a table.
<!--
- Data Frames can have different types of data inside it. While the first column can be character, the second and third can be numeric or logical. 

- Following are the characteristics of a data frame.
  - The column names should be non-empty.
  - The row names should be unique.
  - The data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type.
  - Each column should contain same number of data items.

Use the **data.frame()** function to create a data frame:-->

### Snippet 1

Populating the dataframe:

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=300}

# Load the dataset into the moody variable
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

# Now lets view the dataframe moody with just 5-6 tuples
head(moody)
```

### Snippet 2 

Get the summary of the dataframe:

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=300}

# Load the dataset into the moody variable
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

# Use the summary() function to summarize the data from a Data Frame:
summary(moody)
```
<!--
- Just like vectors, you can access specific data **(Slicing)** in dataframes using brackets. 
- But now, instead of just using one indexing vector, we use two indexing vectors: one for the rows and one for the columns. -->

### Snippet 3 

Use the notation **data[rows, columns]**, which selects the subsets of rows and columns:

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=500}

# Load the dataset into the moody variable
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

# Return row 1
moody[1, ]

# Return column 5
moody[, 5]

# Rows 1:5 and column 2
moody[1:5, 2]

# Give me rows 1-3 and columns 2 and 4 of moody
moody[1:3, c(2:4)]
```

```

- **table()** displays frequency distribution of its arguments. 

<!--
- Tables (i.e. frequency distribution table) can be created using **table()** along with some of its variations. 
- To use **table()**, simply add in the variables you want to tabulate separated by a comma. 
- You must reference the variable using **dataset$variable**. 
- By default, missing values are excluded from the counts; if you want a count for these missing values you must specify the argument **useNA=“ifany”** or **useNA=“always”**. -->
### Snippet 1

The below examples show how to use this function:

```{r, tut=TRUE,height=400}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load

#lets make a table for the grades of students and counts of students for each Grade. 
grades <- table(moody$grade)

#lets see the above frequency distrbuted tables
grades
```

### Code Review
#### What would R say?

```{r, tut=TRUE,height=400}
moody <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

table(moody[moody$questions!='always',]$grade)
#What will R say?

# A. error
# B. distribution of grades for students who always ask questions
# C. distribution of grades for students who do not always ask questions 
```

#### What would R say?

```{r, tut=TRUE,height=400}
moody <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

table(moody[moody$questions==('always','never'),]$grade)
#What will R say?

# A. error.
# B. distribution of grades for students who always or never ask questions.  
# C. distribution of grades for students who do not ask questions always or never. 
```

<br />

```{r,echo=FALSE}

## Scatter Plot

- Scatter Plot are used to plot two numerical variables.
- Hence it is used when both the labels are numerical values.


Lets look at example of scatter plot using Moody.

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# Let's look at a 2 attribute scatter plot.
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
plot(moody$participation,moody$score,ylab="score",xlab="participation",main=" Participation vs Score",col="red")


```

---

## Bar Plot

- A bar plot are used to plot a categorical variable. 
- This rectangle height is proportional to the value of the variable in the vector.
<!--
- Barplots are also used to graphically represent the distribution of a categorical variable, after converting the categorical vector into a table(i.e. frequency distribution table)
- In a bar plot, you can also give different colors to each bar. -->



```{r, tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#lets make a table for the grades of students and counts of students for each Grade. 

t<-table(moody$grade)

#once we have the table lets create a barplot for it.

barplot(t,xlab="Grade",ylab="Number of Students",col=colors, 
        main="Barplot for student grade distribution",border="black")
```


---

##  Box Plot

- A boxplot is used to display a numerical variable.
- A boxplot shows the distribution of data in a dataset. 

![Boxplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/boxplot1.png)
<br />

- A boxplot shows the following things:
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Median
  - First quartile
  - Third quartile
  - Outliers
  
<!--
- You can create a single boxplot using just a vector or a multiple boxplot using a formula.
- When you write a formula, you should use the Tilde (~) operator. This column name on the left side of this operator goes on the y axis and the column name on the right side of this operator goes on the x axis.-->



```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#Suppose you want to find the distribution of students score per Grade. We use box plot for getting that. 
boxplot(score~grade,data=moody,xlab="Grade",ylab="Score", main="Boxplot of grade vs score",col=colors,border="black")

# the circles represent outliers.
```


<!-- ## 4. Histogram -->

<!-- Refer Slide 15. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #Suppose you want to find the frequecy/distribution of cars with mileage in particular range. We use histogram for this.  -->

<!-- hist(automobile$`city-mpg`,xlim = c(0,100),xlab = 'milage', main = "Histogram of Car milage",col=colors,border="black") -->

<!-- # You can Change column range using breaks. -->

<!-- ``` -->


<!-- For more detail,reference and example refer Slides -->



---
##  Mosaic Plot

- Mosaic plot is used to visualize two categorical variables.

<!--
- Mosaic plot is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables.
- The length of the rectangles in the mosaic plot represents the frequency of that particular value.
- The width and length of the mosaic plot can be used to interpret the frequencies of the elements.
- For example, if you want to plot the number of individuals per letter grade using a smartphone, you want to look at a mosaic plot. -->


```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#suppose you want to find numbers of students with a particular grade based on their texting habits. Use Mosiac-plot.

mosaicplot(moody$grade~moody$texting,xlab = 'Grade',ylab = 'Texting habit', main = "Mosiac of grade vs texing habit in class",col=colors,border="black")


```

## Basic Functions

### mean()

- **mean()** function is used to find the average of values in a numerical vector.

```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

#Lets look at the mean of score column.
mean(moody$score)
```


### length()

- **length()** function is used to get the number of elements in any vector

```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

#Lets look at the length of the grade column 
length(moody$grade)
```

### max()

- **max()** function is used to get the maximum value in a numerical vector.

```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

## tapply {#tapply}

- **tapply()** computes a measure (mean, median, min, max, etc..) or a function for each factor variable in a vector. It is a very useful function that lets you create a subset of a vector and then apply some functions to each of the subset.
- tapply(numerical, categorical, aggregagte function)

## Derived Attribute

R allows creating new data frame attributes (columns) “on the fly”.  These are new vectors, which are often defined as functions of existing attributes. Hence, the name - derived  attributes. 

Derived attributes will play an important role  in data exploration as well as in building prediction models. Very often, derived attributes allow discovery of important patterns in data. Similarly, derived attributes may be more predictive than original attributes in the imported data sets.

The term feature engineering is often used in machine learning to describe creation of derived attributes.

### Snippet 1  - Making  new categorical attribute. 
 
The  line 4 initializes the new attribute PF (Pass/Fail) to "Pass".  The line 5 replaces "Pass" by “Fail”  for students who received F. This new attribute, PF, will allow exploratory analysis to find “How to pass Professor Moody’s class”. The answer to this question may be different than then answer to “How to get a good grade in Professor Moody’s class”.


```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/MOODY-2019.csv")

# Cut Example using breaks - Cutting data using defined vector. 
moody$PF<-'Pass'
moody[moody$GRADE=='F',]$PF<-'Fail'

# lets see our added column PF
moody

```



### Cut 

- **cut()** function  divides the range of x into intervals. Provides ability to label intervals as well. It plays important role in defining derived attributes from attributes which are numerical.

```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/MOODY-2019.csv")

# Cut Example using breaks - Cutting data using defined vector. 
score1 <- cut(moody$SCORE,breaks=c(0,50,100),labels=c("F","P"))
table(score1)

```

### Code Review
#### What would R say?

```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/MOODY-2019.csv")

cut(moody$SCORE, breaks=c(0,25,70,100),labels=c("low", "medium", "high"))
#What would R say?

# A. 5 intervals of attribute score
# B. 3 intervals (0,25) (25,70) (75,100)
# C. 3 categorical values "low", "medium" and "high" for different score intervals
# D. 3 separate datasets with similar score values

```

#### What would R say?

```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/MOODY-2019.csv")

output<-cut(moody$SCORE, 5)
summary(output)
#What would R say?

# A. 5 intervals of attribute score of unequal count of elements
# B. 5 intervals of attribute score of equal count of elements
# C. 5 categorical values for different score intervals
# D. 5 separate dataset with similar score values

```

#### What would R say?

```{r}
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/MOODY-2019.csv")

output<-cut(moody$ASKS_QUESTIONS, 2)
summary(output)
#What would R say?

# A. 2 intervals of attribute ask_questions of unequal count of elements in each interval
# B. 2 intervals of attribute ask_questions of equal count of elements in each interval
# C. 2 categorical values for different ask_questions intervals
# D. Error.

```

#### More complex  example of defining derived attributes

The next snippet  illustrates defining a new numerical attribute, $adjustedScore of a student in the Moody data frame.  

Score is adjusted by the value of participation attribute in the following way:   

- If participation is larger than 0.5 - a bonus proportional to participation * 10 is added to the score.  

- If participation is smaller than 0.5, a penalty of 1-participation) * 10 is subtracted from the score. 

In this way, for someone with very small participation, the 10 point penalty will be imposed (10 points subtracted from the score). Conversely,  someone with perfect participation (1.0) will receive a 10 point bonus.

Moody Data Puzzle is our first example of a data puzzle. By data puzzles we mean synthetically generated data sets which have some embedded patterns. Your goal is to find the embedded pattern(s). You may also find patterns similar  (implied) by patterns embedded in the data puzzle. This is fine too. The goal of data puzzles is to excite you about exploratory data analysis. In many ways it is like a game.

**Puzzle description:**

Professor Moody has been teaching statistics 101 class for many years. His teaching evaluations went considerably south with the chief complaint:  he DOES NOT seem to assign grades fairly.   Students compared their scores among themselves and found quite a bit of discrepancies! But their complaints went nowhere since Professor promptly disappeared after posting the final grades and scores.

A new brave TA,  managed to get hold of the carefully maintained grading table (spanning multiple years) of professor Moody by ….messing a bit with Moody's computer….well,  let's not explain the details because he would get in trouble. What he found out was a remarkably structured account of how professor Moody assigns his grades.  

Looks like Professor Moody is in fact very alert in class. He is aware of  what students do,  detecting texting during class and remembering exactly who was dozed off in  class.  He also keeps the mysterious "participation index" which is a numerical score from 0 to 1. This is probably related to questions asked and answered by students as well as their general attentiveness in class.  Remarkable but a little creepy, isn't it?

What is the best advice the new TA, can give future students how to get a good grade in Professor Moody's class? What factors influence the grade besides the score? Back your recommendation up with plots and evidence from the attached data.

**What are examples of patterns we are looking for here?**   

Here are some:

- “Students who text a lot” have lower chance to get an A in the class”
- “Students whose participation is lower than 0.25 fail the class more often”
- “Dozing off does not matter if your score is more than 90, you still get an A”
- “If you score is less than 30, you fail the class regardless of what your other attributes are”

Many student solutions falsely attribute higher grades to higher values of participation attribute..  

This is a classic example of a hidden variable described in the reference attached below. 

The truth is that participation attribute value impacts the  score  attribute value. Generally, the higher the participation in Moody’s class, the higher the score.  But it is the  score attribute which has a direct impact on the grade. Thus, it is the score which is  the real "hidden variable" impacting  the final grade. 

Thus, the score already reflects participation. Professor Moody seemed to look only at texting and dozing off attributes in grade determination (see the power points above  with the explanation) 


Compare with examples of hidden variables in the following reference about correlation and causation.

## Introduction

The following synthetic data describes daily traffic on weekday and weekend days in Lincoln and Holland tunnels. The data frame has three attributes: TUNNEL, DAY and VOLUME_PER_MINUTE.  Below we show a small sample of the TRAFFIC data frame

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
traffic<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/Traffic2022.csv") #web load
# head(moody)
temp<-knitr::kable(
  traffic[sample(1:nrow(traffic),10), ], caption = 'Snippet of Traffic Dataset',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
library(kableExtra)
kableExtra::scroll_box(temp,width = "100%")
```
<br>

The following snippet **6.2** shows the code for hypothesis test of difference of means.

Is the mean traffic (VOLUME_PER_MINUTE)  in the Holland tunnel bigger than  mean  traffic (VOLUME_PER_MINUTE)  in the Lincoln? 

## Snippet 1: Shows the code for z-test to test the following hypotheses

**Null Hypothesis** - Traffic in Holland tunnel is the same as traffic in Lincoln tunnel.

**Alternative Hypothesis** - Traffic in the Holland Tunnel is larger than traffic in the Lincoln  tunnel.

In the snippet **6.2**  we end up calculating the p-value which leads to rejection of Null hypothesis (good news for data scientist, bad for the sceptic).  Indeed, p-value is less than the significance level  of 5%.
This means, that under null hypothesis it is extremely unlikely (less than 5% chance) to see the result which is at least as big as the  observed difference of means.

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=850}

TRAFFIC<-read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/Traffic2022.csv')

#data clean and subset, either
lincoln.data <- subset(TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC$TUNNEL == "Lincoln")
holland.data <- subset(TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC$TUNNEL == "Holland")

#traffic at lincoln
lincoln.traffic <- lincoln.data$VOLUME_PER_MINUTE

#traffic at holland
holland.traffic <- holland.data$VOLUME_PER_MINUTE

# standard deviation of two samples.
sd.lincoln <- sd(lincoln.traffic)
sd.holland <- sd(holland.traffic)
sd.lincoln
sd.holland

#length of lincoln and holland
len_lincoln <- length(lincoln.traffic)
len_holland <- length(holland.traffic)
len_lincoln
len_holland

#standard deviation of difference traffic
sd.lin.hol <- sqrt(sd.lincoln^2/len_lincoln + sd.holland^2/len_holland)
sd.lin.hol

#means of two samples
mean.lincoln <- mean(lincoln.traffic)
mean.holland <- mean(holland.traffic)
mean.lincoln
mean.holland

#z score
zeta <- (mean.lincoln - mean.holland)/sd.lin.hol
zeta

#plot red line
plot(x=seq(from = -5, to= 5, by=0.1),y=dnorm(seq(from = -5, to= 5,  by=0.1),mean=0),type='l',xlab = 'mean difference',  ylab='possibility')
abline(v=zeta, col='red')

#get p
p = 1-pnorm(zeta)
p
```

## Snippet 2: Make your own data and see how p-value changes

How p-value is affected by difference of means and standard deviations.

We will build two distributions ourselves - varying the means and standard deviations. We will use **rnorm()** to generate normal distributions with given means and standard deviations. Then we will use a permutation test (can be a z-test as well) to test the difference of means for these two synthetic distributions. See for yourself the impact means and standard deviations have on p-values. You can do it by changing values of mean and standard deviation in the **rnorm()** function.

Clearly the further apart the mean values are - the lower the p-value. But how do standard deviations affect the p-value?  See for yourself.

Build the data frame with two attributes: Cat and Val, using **rnorm()** function

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
Val1<-rnorm(10,mean=25, sd=10)
Val2<-rnorm(10,mean=35, sd=10)
Cat1<-rep("GroupA",10)  
Cat2<-rep("GroupB",10)  
Cat<-c(Cat1,Cat2) 
Val<-c(Val1,Val2)

d<-data.frame(Cat,Val)
Observed_Difference<-mean(d[d$Cat=='GroupB',2])-mean(d[d$Cat=='GroupA',2])
Observed_Difference

dA<-d[d$Cat=='GroupA',]
dA
dB<-d[d$Cat=='GroupB',]
dB

meanA<-mean(dA$Val)
meanB<-mean(dB$Val)

sdA<-sd(dA$Val)
sdB<-sd(dB$Val)

lenA<-nrow(dA)
lenA
lenB<-nrow(dB)
lenB

sd.A.B <- sqrt(sdA^2/lenA +sdB^2/lenB)
sd.A.B

zeta <- (meanB - meanA)/sd.A.B
zeta
p<-1-pnorm(zeta)
p
```

## Snippet 1

**Exercise** - How p-value is affected by difference of means and standard deviations

We will build our two distributions ourseleves - varying the means and standard deviations.  We will use **rnorm()** to generate normal distributions with given means and standard deviations. Then we will use permutation test (can be z-test as well) to test difference of means for these two synthetic distributions. See for yourself the impact means and standard deviations have on p-values.

Build the data frame with two attributes: **Cat** and **Val**, using **rnorm()** function

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=600}
Val1<-rnorm(10,mean=25, sd=10)
Val2<-rnorm(10,mean=30, sd=10)
 
Cat1<-rep("GroupA",10)  # for example GroupA can be Holland Tunnel
Cat2<-rep("GroupB",10)  # for example Group B will be Lincoln Tunnel

Cat1
Cat2

#The rep command will repeat, the variables will be of type character and will contain 10 values each.

Cat<-c(Cat1,Cat2) # A variable with first 10 values GroupA and next 10 values GroupB
Cat

Val<-c(Val1,Val2)
Val

d<-data.frame(Cat,Val)
d

Observed_Difference<-mean(d[d$Cat=='GroupB',2])-mean(d[d$Cat=='GroupA',2])
Observed_Difference

#This will calculate the mean of the second column (having 10 random values for each group), and the mean of groupB values is subtracted from the mean of groupA values, which will give you the value of the difference of the mean.
 
 #Try changing mean and sd values. When you run this you will see that the difference is sometimes negative #or sometimes positive.
```

## Snippet 2

Do this in your R studio, since we cannot install our package in data camp service we are using to run the code snippets

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=300}
#install.packages("devtools")

 #devtools::install_github("devanshagr/PermutationTestSecond")
 #PermutationTestSecond::Permutation(d, "Cat", "Val",10000, "GroupA", "GroupB")
 
 #The Permutation function returns the absolute value of the difference. So the red line is the absolute value of the observed difference. You will see a histogram having a normal distribution with a red showing the observed difference.
```

## Snippet 3

One permutation at a time

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=400}
traffic<-read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/Traffic2022.csv')

ranNum <- sample(1:nrow(traffic),nrow(traffic))
ranNum[1:5]

VOLUME_PER_MINUTE<-traffic$VOLUME_PER_MINUTE[ranNum]
TUNNEL<-traffic$TUNNEL

Permuted_traffic<-data.frame(TUNNEL, VOLUME_PER_MINUTE)

mean(traffic[traffic$TUNNEL=='Lincoln', ]$VOLUME_PER_MINUTE) -mean(traffic[traffic$TUNNEL=='Holland', ]$VOLUME_PER_MINUTE)

mean(Permuted_traffic[Permuted_traffic$TUNNEL=='Lincoln', ]$VOLUME_PER_MINUTE)-mean(Permuted_traffic[Permuted_traffic$TUNNEL=='Holland', ]$VOLUME_PER_MINUTE)
```
