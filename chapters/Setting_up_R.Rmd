<!-- You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods). -->

<!-- Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. -->


<!-- ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). -->

<!-- ```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', -->
<!--   booktabs = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. -->

After installing R studio successfully the first step is to create a project R studio. 

- Step 1: Go to **File -> New Project**

![New Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/1_text.png)

- Step 2: Select **New Directory**

![New Directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/2_text.png)

- Step 3: Select **New Project**

![New Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/3_text.png)

- Step 4: Give your preferred directory name like **"Data101_Assignmnets"**

![Directory Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/4_text.png)

- Step 5: Click on Create Project and finally the R studio should look like

![Rstudio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/4.5_text.png)

## How to upload a data set?
<script src="files/js/dcl.js"></script>
```{r ,include=FALSE}
tutorial::go_interactive()

```

 - To upload the dataset/file present in csv format the read.csv() and read.csv2() functions are frequently used The read.csv() and read.csv2() have different separator symbol: for the former this is a comma, whereas the latter uses a semicolon.

- There are two options while accessing the dataset from your local machine:
  1. To avoid giving long directory paths for accessing the dataset, one should use the command **getwd()** to get the current working directory and store the dataset in the same directory. To access the dataset stored in the same directory one can use the following: **read.csv("moody2020.csv")**
  2. One can also store the dataset at a different location and can access it using the following command: (Suppose the dataset is stored inside the folder Data101_Tutorials on the desktop)
    - For Windows Users.
      - Example: **read.csv("C:/Users/Desktop/Data101_Tutorials/moody2020.csv")**

    - For MAC Users.
      - Example: **read.csv("/Users/Desktop/Data101_Tutorials/moody2020.csv")**
          
**Note: **
The directory path given here is the current working directory hosted on *Github* where the dataset has been stored.
```{r, tut=TRUE}

# Read in the data
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv")

# Print out `df`
head(df)
```
