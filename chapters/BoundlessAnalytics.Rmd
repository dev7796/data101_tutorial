## Snippet 1: Chi square hunt

# Say, the Boundless analytics provides us with the slice:  Beer =='Lager' &  Day =='Weekend' and Snacks ='Crackers' and anchor attribute is Location.  You can calculate Chisq for this slice and the Location attribute to test if distribution of locations is affected if we limit ourselves only to transactions selling Lager and Crackers on Weekends?  

# The most interesting slice-anchor attribute combinations are the ones with the largest chisq test and lowest p-value. Nevertheless do not forget about multiple hypothesis correction - since we can on chi-square hunt here!
