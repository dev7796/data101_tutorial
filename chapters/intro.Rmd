<!-- You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods). -->

<!-- Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. -->


<!-- ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). -->

<!-- ```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', -->
<!--   booktabs = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. -->


The objective of this textbook is to provide you with the shortest path to exploring your data, visualizing it, forming hypotheses and validating and defending them. 

Given a data set, you want to be able to make any plot you wish, find plots which show something actionable and interesting, explore data by slicing and dicing it and finally present your results in a statistically convincing manner, perhaps in a colorful and visually appealing way.  Finally, you will be able to apply some basic machine learning methods to build, train and test prediction models.  All of this will be accomplished in a succinct and crisp way using a small subset of R instructions. 

It is an active textbook. It assumes no prior programming background.  We will teach you as little R as possible to achieve the goals of this book which are quite impressive. In fact you will be able to do a good chunk of work which data scientists do.  We will accomplish this goal through active snippets of executable code. These are examples of R code (**around 80 executable snippets of code**) embedded in  the textbook itself.  More importantly, you will be able to modify the code and execute the modified code without need to install any application on your machine.  This will allow you to understand the code in the book through “what if”  exploratory process. Thus, every code snippet is just an invitation to endless modifications. This is why we call this textbook - an active textbook.

Another unique aspect of this textbook is its reliance on data puzzles. These are synthetic data sets with embedded patterns and rules generated by our tool called **DataMaker**. We will present our data puzzles (dynamic list, may vary from year to year) in section 4 and follow by showing how to make plots of data.  Then we will proceed to freestyle data exploration.  This will allow us to learn  more about our data,  form the leads, and finally state our hypotheses.  We will follow up by an elementary introduction to hypothesis testing through a permutation test.  We will learn how to calculate p-values and how to use them to defend our findings against the  randomness trap.

We will use as few R functions as possible to achieve our goals. In fact we will demonstrate how using **less than ten R functions** we can perform quite sophisticated data exploration. In the appendix, we show many more useful commands of R which eventually you would have to use. However, our goal in this short textbook, is to present the shortest path to data analysis which will let you import the data, plot it, make some analysis yourself and use R-libraries to build machine learning models.  In this textbook and in this class we do not teach how to clean the data (data wrangling) and how to deal with a wide variety of data types. We also do not address complex data transformations such as multi-frame operations like merge function. We also do not explain how different machine learning methods work, we only show you how to use them. It is similar to teaching one how to drive a car without knowing how a car engine works. 

Sections **5.6** and **5.7** provide the lists of all concepts which we cover in our active textbook and all R functions which are needed.  Notice how small the set of R functions is.  It is important for programming novices to start small and also see how far this small set of functions can get you. 

Our **question roulette** allows self-testing on nearly 100 questions relevant to the material. Each question is answered, but students are encouraged first to answer questions themselves and only then follow it with checking the correct answer.
