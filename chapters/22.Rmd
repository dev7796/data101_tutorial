## Introduction

In this section we demonstrate application of Boundless Analytics - the tool developed by Tomasz Imielinski and his team at Rutgers (and supported by NSF subcontract of Center of Science of Information at Purdue University). Boundless Analytics calculates all significant bar graphs from the data set and allows to find data subsets (slices) which deviate the most from the whole data set in regard to frequency distribution of an attribute. Boundless performs an otherwise very tedious task of looking at all combinations of attribute value pairs to identify the “significant ones” - saving enormous amounts of work in preliminary exploration of data. 

We are using here the Minimarket  data puzzle \@ref(minimarket) describing customer transactions in the small chain of minimarkets in NJ. Data 101 students used Boundless Analytics to discover the most interesting subsets of this data set

## The Boundless Analytics web application 

**Boundless Analytics Interface:** http://209.97.156.178:8082/

(it is a soft login abc/abc will do)

**Objective: Nominate  the most interesting subset of  the Minimarket2022 data set**

Seems open ended, no? what is the "most interesting"?

- Chi-square value is a good measure. We explain it below.

- By swiping through possible plots (using Next), one can identify good candidates for the “interesting data subsets”) 

- These are plots where red and blue bars differ the most.  In other words we want to reject the null hypothesis of independence of red and blue distributions over the data slice and the complement of the data slice. The higher the chi-square is, the strongest is our rejection of independence of **red** and **blue** distributions. 

Therefore this task can be seen as chi-square hunt for the highest chi-square value  (use the  snippet **17.1** code after plugging in definition of a slice and the anchor attribute)

## Snippet 1: Chi square hunt

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=600}

# Say, the Boundless analytics provides us with the slice:  Beer =='Lager' &  Day =='Weekend' and Snacks ='Crackers' and anchor attribute is Location.  You can calculate Chisq for this slice and the Location attribute to test if distribution of locations is affected if we limit ourselves only to transactions selling Lager and Crackers on Weekends?  

# The most interesting slice-anchor attribute combinations are the ones with the largest chisq test and lowest p-value. Nevertheless do not forget about multiple hypothesis correction - since we can on chi-square hunt here!

Minimarket<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/HomeworkMarket2022.csv")

Minimarket$IN<-'Out_Slice'
Minimarket[Minimarket$Beer=='Lager' & Minimarket$Day=='Weekend' &  Minimarket$Snacks =='Crackers', ]$IN<-'In_Slice'
d<-table(Minimarket$Location, Minimarket$IN)
chisq.test(d)

**RESULTS: **

Here are two out of 250+ submissions.  The one with the highest chi-square of `600.15` is the slice  showing **weekend** buyers of **lager** in **New brunswick** but disproportionately more snacks (in particular Crackers). This was identified by nearly 20 students.

Here is another find by Eva Zhang showing disproportionately frequent **sales of Coca Cola** on **Weekdays** in **Princeton** for transactions which purchased Popcorn. The chi-square  value of this find is `205.31`, with  df=3.
