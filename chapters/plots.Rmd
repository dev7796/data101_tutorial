### Scatter Plot

- Scatter Plot are used to plot points on the Cartesian plane (X-Y Plane)
- Hence it is used when both the labels are numerical values.


Lets look at example of scatter plot using Moody.
```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# Let's look at a 2 attribute scatter plot.
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeplokhande/data101demobook/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
plot(moody$participation,moody$score,ylab="score",xlab="participation",main=" Participation vs Score",col="red")


```


---

### Bar Plot

- A bar plot is used to plot rectangular bars proportional to the values present in a numerical vector. 
- This rectangle height is proportional to the value of the variable in the vector.
- Barplots are also used to graphically represent the distribution of a categorical variable, after converting the categorical vector into a table(i.e. frequency distribution table)
- In a bar plot, you can also give different colors to each bar.



```{r, tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeplokhande/data101demobook/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#lets make a table for the grades of students and counts of students for each Grade. 

t<-table(moody$grade)

#once we have the table lets create a barplot for it.

barplot(t,xlab="Grade",ylab="Number of Students",col=colors,
main="Barplot for student grade distribution",border="black")
```

###  Box Plot

- A boxplot shows the distribution of data in a dataset. 
- A boxplot shows the following things:
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Median
  - First quartile
  - Third quartile
  - Outliers
- You can create a single boxplot using just a vector or a multiple boxplot using a formula.
- When you write a formula, you should use the Tilde (~) operator. This column name on the left side of this operator goes on the y axis and the column name on the right side of this operator goes on the x axis.



```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeplokhande/data101demobook/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars


#Suppose you want to find the distribution of students score per Grade. We use box plot for getting that. 
boxplot(score~grade,data=moody,xlab="Grade",ylab="Score", main="Boxplot of grade vs score",col=colors,border="black")

# the circles represent outliers.
```


<!-- ## 4. Histogram -->

<!-- Refer Slide 15. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #Suppose you want to find the frequecy/distribution of cars with mileage in particular range. We use histogram for this.  -->

<!-- hist(automobile$`city-mpg`,xlim = c(0,100),xlab = 'milage', main = "Histogram of Car milage",col=colors,border="black") -->

<!-- # You can Change column range using breaks. -->

<!-- ``` -->

###  Mosiac Plot

- Mosaic plot is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables.
- The length of the rectangles in the mosaic plot represents the frequency of that particular value.
- The width and length of the mosaic plot can be used to interpret the frequencies of the elements.
-For example, if you want to plot the number of individuals per letter grade using a smartphone, you want to look at mosiac plot.


```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeplokhande/data101demobook/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#suppose you want to find numbers of students with a particular grade based on their texting habits. Use Mosiac-plot.

mosaicplot(moody$grade~moody$texting,xlab = 'Grade',ylab = 'Texting habit', main = "Mosiac of grade vs texing habit in class",col=colors,border="black")
