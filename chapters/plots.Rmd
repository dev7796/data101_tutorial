When you import your data to R studio one of the first things you do is plot. Data visualization is a key components of data analysis. Before we talk about plots, we introduce some very basis data structures in R: vectors, data frames and tables.  These are introduced below in the form of code snippets that you can run and modify. 

**Then we are ready to plot!**

We will introduce several basic plots such as scatter plot, bar plot, boxplot and mosaic plot.  How do we know which plot to apply?  It depends on whether the variables to be plotted are categorical or  numerical.   Below we show a simple table which can serve as a guide which plot to use depending on types of variables to be plotted.

## Scatter Plot {#scartterplot}

- Scatter Plot are used to plot two numerical variables.
- Hence it is used when both the labels are numerical values.


Lets look at example of scatter plot using Moody.

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# Let's look at a 2 attribute scatter plot.
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
plot(moody$participation,moody$score,ylab="score",xlab="participation",main=" Participation vs Score",col="red")


```

---

## Bar Plot {#barplot}

- A bar plot are used to plot a categorical variable. 
- This rectangle height is proportional to the value of the variable in the vector.
<!--
- Barplots are also used to graphically represent the distribution of a categorical variable, after converting the categorical vector into a table(i.e. frequency distribution table)
- In a bar plot, you can also give different colors to each bar. -->



```{r, tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#lets make a table for the grades of students and counts of students for each Grade. 

t<-table(moody$grade)

#once we have the table lets create a barplot for it.

barplot(t,xlab="Grade",ylab="Number of Students",col=colors, 
        main="Barplot for student grade distribution",border="black")
```

##  Box Plot {#boxplot}

- A boxplot is used to display a numerical variable.
- A boxplot shows the distribution of data in a dataset. 

![Boxplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/img/plots/boxplot1.png)
<br />

- A boxplot shows the following things:
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Median
  - First quartile
  - Third quartile
  - Outliers
  
<!--
- You can create a single boxplot using just a vector or a multiple boxplot using a formula.
- When you write a formula, you should use the Tilde (~) operator. This column name on the left side of this operator goes on the y axis and the column name on the right side of this operator goes on the x axis.-->



```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#Suppose you want to find the distribution of students score per Grade. We use box plot for getting that. 
boxplot(score~grade,data=moody,xlab="Grade",ylab="Score", main="Boxplot of grade vs score",col=colors,border="black")

# the circles represent outliers.
```


<!-- ## 4. Histogram -->

<!-- Refer Slide 15. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #Suppose you want to find the frequecy/distribution of cars with mileage in particular range. We use histogram for this.  -->

<!-- hist(automobile$`city-mpg`,xlim = c(0,100),xlab = 'milage', main = "Histogram of Car milage",col=colors,border="black") -->

<!-- # You can Change column range using breaks. -->

<!-- ``` -->


<!-- For more detail,reference and example refer Slides -->

##  Mosaic Plot {#mosaicplot}

- Mosaic plot is used to visualize two categorical variables.

<!--
- Mosaic plot is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables.
- The length of the rectangles in the mosaic plot represents the frequency of that particular value.
- The width and length of the mosaic plot can be used to interpret the frequencies of the elements.
- For example, if you want to plot the number of individuals per letter grade using a smartphone, you want to look at a mosaic plot. -->


```{r,tut=TRUE,height=700}
# moody<-read.csv("../files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #static Load
moody<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev7796/data101_tutorial/main/files/dataset/moody2020b.csv") #web load
colors<- c('red','blue','cyan','yellow','green') # Assigning different colors to bars

#suppose you want to find numbers of students with a particular grade based on their texting habits. Use Mosiac-plot.

mosaicplot(moody$grade~moody$texting,xlab = 'Grade',ylab = 'Texting habit', main = "Mosiac of grade vs texing habit in class",col=colors,border="black")


```
