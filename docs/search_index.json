[["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction The objective of this textbook is to provide you with the shortest path to exploring your data, visualizing it, forming hypotheses and validating and defending them. Given a data set, you want to be able to make any plot you wish, find plots which show something actionable and interesting, explore data by slicing and dicing it and finally present your results in a statistically convincing manner, perhaps in a colorful and visually appealing way. Questions which you will have to anticipate and you will have to answer are - How do you know that your findings are not random? - And fundamental of all questions: - So what? Even the most impressing looking results may come up randomly. And you will be asked this question along with the question “what was your p-value and how did you compute it” And even if you convince your audience that your results are not random, you will have to be ready to explain why your audience should care about the results you reported. In other words, is there any actionable value in your results? Or they are just simply interesting, good to know, but no one really needs to care much about them otherwise? Hopefully it is the former not the latter. In the following sections we will address these questions and go through the process of data exploration, validation, and presentation. We will start with making plots, follow with free style data exploration – which allows us to form the leads, that is hypotheses. Then we will follow with simple statistical tests which will allow us to validate these hypothesis and defend our findings against randomness claims. - We will learn how to calculate p-values and how to use them to defend our findings. We will use as few R commands as possible and reach our goal in the shortest possible path. In fact we will demonstrate how using just 7 R commands we can perform quite sophisticated data exploration. In the appendix, we show many more useful commands of R which eventually you would have to use. However, our goal in this short textbook, is to present the shortest path to data analysis which will let you import the data, plot it, make some analysis yourself and use R-libraries. In this textbook and in this class we do not teach how to clean the data (data wrangling) and how to deal with a wide variety of data types. We also do not address complex data transformations such as multi-frame operations like merge (we show them in appendix). We also do not explain how different machine learning methods work, we only show you how to use them. It is similar to teaching one how to drive a car without knowing how a car engine works.

"],["how-to-upload-a-data-set.html", "Chapter 3 How to upload a data set?", " Chapter 3 How to upload a data set? To upload the dataset/file present in csv format the read.csv() and read.csv2() functions are frequently used The read.csv() and read.csv2() have different separator symbol: for the former this is a comma, whereas the latter uses a semicolon. There are two options while accessing the dataset from your local machine: To avoid giving long directory paths for accessing the dataset, one should use the command getwd() to get the current working directory and store the dataset in the same directory. To access the dataset stored in the same directory one can use the following: read.csv(“moody2020.csv”) One can also store the dataset at a different location and can access it using the following command: (Suppose the dataset is stored inside the folder Data101_Tutorials on the desktop) For Windows Users. Example: read.csv(“C:/Users/Desktop/Data101_Tutorials/moody2020.csv”) For MAC Users. Example: read.csv(“/Users/Desktop/Data101_Tutorials/moody2020.csv”) Note: The directory path given here is the current working directory hosted on Github where the dataset has been stored. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFJlYWQgaW4gdGhlIGRhdGFcbmRmIDwtIHJlYWQuY3N2KFwiaHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2Rldjc3OTYvZGF0YTEwMV90dXRvcmlhbC9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIilcblxuIyBQcmludCBvdXQgYGRmYFxuaGVhZChkZikifQ== "]]
